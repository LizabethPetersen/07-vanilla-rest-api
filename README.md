# Lab 07: Vanilla HTTP Server

## Documentation
Add your Travis badge to to the top of your README.md **if you are writing tests**. Tell a user how to use your API. List out the routes you have registered and explain the RESTful verbs a user must use to get a valid response. Explain what is received when a valid request is made and what is received when an invalid request is made.
